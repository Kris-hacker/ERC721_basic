# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
.env
```shell
API_URL = "https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<API_KEY>"
PRIVATE_KEY = "<Metamask wallet Private key>"
```
